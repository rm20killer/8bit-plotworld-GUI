    firstgreeting:
      text: <white>Well you see, I’ve been assigned to the 8-Bit community server
        for this Holiday season! I figured I'd arrive early to get the job done as
        journeying through the cosmos does take a bit of time haha.

    part1:
      text: <white>Truth is Santa tasked me with delivering the gifts for the 8 Bit
        Community this year as to lessen the load for the big guy! Well, thank goodness
        you are here, I assume you are a resident of this 8-Bit community?

    part2:
      text: <white>Oh that's a relief, I almost followed a rabbit's advice that would've
        told me to take a left at Albuquerque. Good thing I didn't listen to him,
        he doesn't seem to know whether it's truly Duck season or Rabbit season, (tbh
        he and the duck were reeaallllyyy going at it).
      next: Player.continue3
    part3:
      text: <white>Anyways, my dilemma is that after I came through the portal, I
        was greeted by stunning beauty of this server's spawn and shopping districts
        that I simply needed to explore.
      next: Player.continue4
    part4:
      text: <white>Upon my arrival I was also greeted by a handsome er... Starlion
        fella? The mystical keeper of the portal to this wonderful land, he told me
        of the great railway system I could use to get around and sent me on my way.
      next: Player.continue5
    part5:
      text: <white>However once I had been around the entirety of the aforementioned
        areas, and on my way here to the central post office, I noticed that my magical
        bag had a hole and lots of presents are gone! It’s a disaster! I can't leave
        all these other presents here but I need to find all the presents or the holidays
        will be ruined!
      next: Player.YesHelp,Player.NoHelp
    instructions:
      text: <white>Thank you! I wrote about all the places I visited in my journal.
        I also made a note of everything that’s missing. That should help you find
        all the missing presents. The missing gifts around spawn will shimmer with
        red christmas magic, which will turn green when found. Once you find all the
        lost gifts, come back and let me know! If you have any questions come and
        talk to me.
